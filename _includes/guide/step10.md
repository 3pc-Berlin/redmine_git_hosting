#### **(step 10)** Add your SSH Keys
***

**Repositories access are based on Redmine project's memberships and members's roles : you must add users with the adequate role as project's member to be able to clone/update repositories.**

**You'll also need to configure roles's permissions on *Administration -> Roles page*.**

Unless you want to access your repositories exclusively via Smart HTTP, users will need to set a public key to connect via SSH.

To do this, open a browser, login to Redmine and follow the *My Account* link in the upper right-hand corner of the page then *Add SSH keys* link.

SSH Keys should be unique, that is, the keys you set in Redmine **should not** already exist in the Gitolite repo.

{{ site.data.callouts.alertdanger }}
  In particular, **do not re-use the key you set as the Gitolite admin key**.
{{ site.data.callouts.end }}

At this point, the plugin should work. If not, take a look here : [Troubleshooting]({{ site.baseurl }}/troubleshooting/).
